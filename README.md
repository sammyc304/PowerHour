# PowerHour
Python tkinter app to create a Power Hour playlist. There are issues with PyTube at the moment, so it is currently not working. The idea is to have a .txt file in the same local directory with a list of youtube music videos (call it videos.txt). Feel free to make a pr with potential fixes.
